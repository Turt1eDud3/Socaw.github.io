# Creations
Down below are links to different projects and creations that members have made that they are willing to share to the public. This includes Games, Music and other little things.

* [God of the Sabbath - Concert Band Arrangment](https://www.noteflight.com/music/titles/6c45eedc-7b90-4485-aae4-00de437b1900) - This arrangment of God of the Sabbath, Created by Jacob, closely resembles the origional piece created by William C. Deland and Mary A. Stillman. This arrangment is written for Concert Band groups. God of the Sabbath was originally written in 1946 for the Seventh Day Baptist Denomination. It came very close to becoming the official song of the Seventh Day Baptists

* [Adventure Game](https://github.com/ncrech/choose-your-adventure/releases/tag/adventure) - A game created by Khloe, its a terminal based game with multiple choices and multiple endings. You can encounter a bunny, or get killed by a creepy guy :)
