* [God of the Sabbath - Concert Band Arrangment](https://www.noteflight.com/music/titles/6c45eedc-7b90-4485-aae4-00de437b1900) - This arrangment of God of the Sabbath closely resembles the origional piece created by William C. Deland and Mary A. Stillman. This arrangment is written for Concert Band groups. God of the Sabbath was originally written in 1946 for the Seventh Day Baptist Denomination. It came very close to becoming the official song of the Seventh Day Baptists
